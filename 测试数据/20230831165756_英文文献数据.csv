A determinants analysis of the presented digital economy metrics describes the level of compatibility as well as the level of incompatibility. Also, this paper aims to analyze digital economy measurement approaches, which have been used by different stakeholders in the economy and society and what we can learn to enhance existing digital economy measurement approaches.",6TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ECONOMY OF INTEGRATION (ICEI 2019): (E)MIGRATION AND COMPETITIVENESS OF SOUTHEASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
Regional Projection of Digital Economy,"Novikova, NV; Strogonova, EV; Dianova, LS",2020,"In the modern scientific agenda, the discussion about the formation, development, and measurement of processes related to the digital economy comes to the fore. The main numbers of works devoted to the problems of the digital economy consider global and national processes. There is an acute lack of regional research, although processes occurring at the regional level form General trends on a national and global scale. The purpose of this research is to develop methodological tools for measuring the scale of the digital economy in the region (macroregion). The authors of the article propose a method for calculating the integral indicator of digitalization of the regional economy. The proposed methodology is based on twelve individual indicators, each of which characterizes the penetration of the digital economy and digital technologies into the territory of the region. The choice of indicators is justified by the authors. The article proves that the processes of deployment of the new industrialization of the Ural macroregion are closely related to the processes of digitalization.",PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CONFERENCE - MODERN MANAGEMENT TRENDS AND THE DIGITAL ECONOMY: FROM REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH (MTDE 2020)

THE DEFINITION OF DIGITAL SHADOW ECONOMY,"Remeikiene, R; Gaspareniene, L; Schneider, FG",2018,"Considering the lack of the scientific studies on the selected topic, the authors of this article raise the aim to set up the definition of digital shadow economy and identify its distinctive features and channels. Thus far, the studies on illegal digital activities have covered ambiguous interpretations of digital shadow economy that incorporated both criminal and economic aspects of the activities performed. The results of the empirical research have enabled to formulate the definition of digital shadow economy that refers to illegal activities, such as digital service provision and sales of goods/services online, when operating exceptionally in digital space, the entities violate the existent legal norms and regulations with a pursuit of illegal mutual interest and material benefits. The newly formulated definition of digital shadow economy has served as a corner-stone for identification of the distinctive features and channels of this phenomenon. Hence, the results of the research may make a significant and weighty contribution to the development of the theory of economics and may raise the awareness of what the phenomenon of digital shadow economy implies.",TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY
Digital Economy: Identification and Measurements Problems in Regional Economy,"Mirolyubova, TV; Karlina, TV; Nikolaev, RS",2020,"The transformation of information into a key economic resource is accompanied with a wide dissemination of information technologies. Information and communication technologies (ICT), software products, computers and telecommunication equipment are already integrated into the structure of all economics activities. The intensification of this process over the past decade has generated a great interest of the Russian academia in such phenomena as digitalization of society and digital economy. In the article, we discuss and define the essence of the phenomenon of digital economp Digital technologies, introduced into socio-economic and technological processes, will certainly be involved in the generation of the value added of the final product (service), regardless of its purpose (type of activity and sector of the economy). Although information and communication products belong to the information and communication technology (10) sector, each economic activity develops, implements and uses its own solutions in the field of ICT, digital labour and digital capital, which are not directly analysed and measured. In this regard, there is a need to improve approaches to assessing and measuring the volume of the digital economy at different territorial levels, including regional economies. We propose a methodology for measuring the digital economy at the regional level and test it, using the economic and statistical analysis of data for the Perm region of Russia. We have structured the digital economy in the region and identified the core of ICT, the outer tier of ICT and the digital sector outside of ICT. We have discovered it appropriate to measure the digital economy of a region or a country through a system of indicators: ICT costs, the number and share of employment in the digital economy, the volume and share of digital production in the economy, digital labour force, digital production capacity.",EKONOMIKA REGIONA-ECONOMY OF REGION
Digital Economy: Distributed Project Financing Systems,"Belyaev, SE",2020,"In modern conditions of the formation and transition to the next technological method of production, the increasingly active use of digital technologies in most industries and sectors of the economy, the study of issues related to digital systems in the field of project financing is becoming increasingly relevant. Distributed project financing systems due to the prevalence and effectiveness of digital technologies makes it possible to raise additional funds including innovative and venture projects, which in recent decades have become the locomotives of the development of the economy as a whole. The article presents the theoretical and methodological foundations of the analysis of distributed project financing systems, digital technologies, their use in distributed project financing in the context of the formation and development of the digital economy in Russia and abroad. The analysis of economic and institutional support of the processes of distributed financing of projects, various digital systems in the field of project financing, experience in the formation of the production and technological base of functioning of distributed financing systems for projects based on digital technologies on the example of such countries as the USA, China, Great Britain and Belarus, which allowed us to propose a scheme for the formation of the production and technological base for the functioning of distributed financial systems projects on the basis of digital technologies in Russia, which will make it possible to switch from an import-dependent role in the global software and hardware markets related to distributed project financing systems to the export-oriented positioning of domestic companies and the high capitalization of the IT technology market. It is proposed to use and adapt the Chinese experience in the formation of the production and technological base for the functioning of distributed project financing systems based on digital technologies, taking into account Russian specifics. In addition it was proposed to use the technology of spatial access to the Internet, big data technology and distributed registry technology for the functioning of distributed project financing systems based on digital technologies. Based on the analysis of practical results on the implementation of digital systems in distributed project financing in a number of leading foreign countries, an author's classification of digital systems in the field of project financing was developed with three classification criteria: technological, institutional and economic. Recommendations are formulated on the use of the following sequence of digital technologies in the field of project finance: a national model of the technological basis for distributed project financing - an adapted institutional form of using digital technologies in project finance - an effective type of economic implementation of digital technologies in project finance.",PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CONFERENCE - MODERN MANAGEMENT TRENDS AND THE DIGITAL ECONOMY: FROM REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH (MTDE 2020)
